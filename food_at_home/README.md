## Food at Home
This is my current project where I am gathering data about food in order to help people make better use of their time and money at the grocery store. 
<br />
The main goals of this project are thus: 
* Gather data on food, recipes, nutrition, and average price and save them in a Postgres database. Future goals are to use an AWS Redshift database
* Visualize the data and summarize the data to show most economical ingredients, simplest recipes, show nutritional data, and more 
* Upload this data vizualization with Tableau to a Public Tableau page
